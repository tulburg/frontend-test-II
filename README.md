## Front-end Developer Test

### Devcenter Frontend Developer Test II

The purpose of this test is not only to quickly gauge an applicant's abilities with working with APIs, but also their approach to development.

Applicants may use whatever frontend techniques they want to achieve the outcome.

## Task

* Using the Spotify API https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/ - Given any particular artist, get their first 10 related artists and list their similar top songs.

* Using the Giphy API https://developers.giphy.com/docs/ - Write a chat input that takes a command, converts the ensuing string into a gif (Like in Slack) and adds it to the conversation

## How to complete the task

1. Fork this repository into your own public repo.

2. Complete the project and commit your work. Send the URL of your own repository to @seun on the Slack here bit.ly/dcs-slack.

## Show your working

If you choose to use build tools to compile your CSS and Javascript (such as SASS of Coffescript) please include the original files as well. You may update this README file outlining the details of what tools you have used.

## Clean code

This fictitious project is part of a larger plan to reuse templates for multiple properties. When authoring your CSS ensure that it is easy for another developer to find and change things such as fonts and colours.


## Good luck!

We look forward to seeing what you can do. Remember, although it is a test, there are no specific right or wrong answers that we are looking for - just do the job as best you can. Any questions - create an issue in the panel on the right (requires a Github account).
